This section details the prerequisites for GitHub.

## GitHub Prerequisites

The accelerator does not support GitHub personal accounts, since they don't support all the features required for security. You must have a GitHub organization account or the accelerator will fail on apply. You can create a free organization [here](https://github.com/organizations/plan). Learn more about account types [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts).

{{< hint type=note >}}
If you choose to use a `free` organization account the accelerator bootstrap will make your repositories public. It must do this to support the functionality required by the accelerator. This is not recommended for production environments.

1. Click `Generate new token` at the top.
1. Enter `Azure Landing Zone Terraform Accelerator` in the `Token name` field.

1. Choose tomorrows date in the date picker.
1. Alter the `Repository access` radio button and select `All repositories`.

1. Click `Generate token`.
1. Copy the token and save it somewhere safe.

If you are using self-hosted runners, you will need to create a second PAT that we'll refer to as `token-2` for them. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Select `No expiration` for the `Expiration` field.

You may want to set a shorter expiration date for security reasons. In either case, you will need to have a process in place to extend expiration the token before it expires.
