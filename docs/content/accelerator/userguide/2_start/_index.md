Phase 2 of the accelerator is to run the bootstrap. Follow the steps below to do that.

## 2.1 Install the ALZ PowerShell module

The ALZ PowerShell module is used to run the bootstrap phase. It is available on the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ALZ/). You can install it using the following steps:

1. Open a PowerShell Core (pwsh) terminal.
2. Check if you already have the ALZ module installed  by running `Get-InstalledModule -Name ALZ`. You'll see something like this if it is already installed:

```powershell
Version    Name                                Repository           Description
-------    ----                                ----------           -----------
1.0.0      ALZ                                 PSGallery            Azure Landing Zones Powershell Module
```

3. If the module is already installed, run `Update-Module -Name ALZ` to ensure you have the latest version.
4. If the module is not installed, run `Install-Module -Name ALZ`.

You are now ready to run the bootstrap and setup your environment. If you want to use custom names for your resources or automate the bootstrap, please refer to our [FAQs](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) section.
