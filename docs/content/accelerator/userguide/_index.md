## Quick Start

For the majority of users, this is the place to start. The quick start is a step by step guide to get your Azure Landing Zone environment up and running.

Now follow the [introduction](#introduction) below.

## Advanced Users

For those users with very specific requirements we provide some advanced capabilities that allow you to override some of the defaults.

See our [FAQ]({{< relref "faq" >}}) and [Advanced Scenarios]({{< relref "advancedscenarios" >}}) for more info.

## Introduction

The quick start guide takes you through the steps to prepare your pre-requisites and then run the PowerShell module.

The accelerator bootstraps a continuous delivery environment for you. It supports both the Azure DevOps and GitHub version control system (VCS). It uses the [ALZ PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ALZ) to gather required user input and apply a Terraform module to configure the bootstrap environment.

The accelerator follows a 3 phase approach:

- [Quick Start Phase 1]({{< relref "1_prerequisites" >}}): Instructions to configure credentials and subscriptions.
- [Quick Start Phase 2]({{< relref "2_start" >}}): Run the PowerShell script to generate the continuous delivery environment.
- [Quick Start Phase 3]({{< relref "3_deploy" >}}): Update the module (if needed) to suit the needs of your organisation and deploy via continuous delivery.
